## Lab 8

This lab will combine loops / simulation with the use of the shinydashboard package. All solutions should be embedded in a shiny dashboard. Please turn in screenshots for each question to degreeworks.

#### 1.  Derive and display the probability of landing on green, red, and black.

#### 2. Use the RouletteSpin() to simulate the probabilities of landing on green, red, and black.

#### 3. Cosmic Pizza: assuming all letters are equally probable simulate whether you can spell cosmic after purchasing 10 pizzas
